Second Assignment for AI and Machine Learning

Problem 1.

Write a program in Julia that uses the hill-climbing algorithm to solve the knapsack problem; a well-known problem in AI. It is generally defined as follows. Consider a set of items, each with a weight and a value, and a collection with a limit. The goal is to determine the number of each item to include in the collection so that the total weight is less or equal to the limit and the total value of the collection as large as possible. Your program will accept the following input:

    number of items;
    weight and value of each item;
    limit of the collection. 
    The program will return the combination of items that represents your solution. 
    It will also display the different steps from the initial configuration to the solution.

Problem 2.

Write a program in Julia that accepts an adversarial game as an input and returns the solution using the minimax algorithm with the alpha-beta pruning strategy. The game should support multiple players with multiple turns for each player.
